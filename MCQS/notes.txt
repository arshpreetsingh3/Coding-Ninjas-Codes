1) malloc alloc free all are included in header file <stdlib.h>
2)mod (%) only can be used with intergers.
3) short ckt condition for logical and && is that if first codn is false then op is always false (will not execute remaining operns arent calculated)
4) short ckt condn for logical or is that if first condn is true then op is always true(remaainig condns are not even checked).
5) print func if equated returns the no of charecters it prints. eg i = printf("abc) then value of i will be 3
6) b = 5,4,3; //here operator precedence takes place as = has more pref than , thus b is assigned first 
   thus b=5
7) b = (5,4,3); here operator precedence takes place as = has less precedence than () thus () executte first also rightmost value is used first always 
   thus b =3
8) printf("%.0f",8.89); //this using this precision prints the next precision value
9) *%/ in left to right precedence 
   +- in left to right precende
